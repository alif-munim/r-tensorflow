# R + TensorFlow
A repository of projects combining the R programming language's capabilities for statistical computing, and the TensorFlow libary's ease of use in coding neural networks on the fly.

### Binary Classification
Ì∫ó [binary-classification](https://github.com/alif-munim/r-tensorflow/blob/master/binary-classification/classification.R) <br/>
A basic project to start my journey with R and TensorFlow. Coded in R Studio, this basic Keras model was trained on just 12 images and can differentiate between planes and cars.

### Decoding the Chicken Scratch
‚úç[mnist-handwriting](https://github.com/alif-munim/r-tensorflow/blob/master/mnist-handwriting/mnist-handwriting.ipynb) My first attempt at using the starter handwriting dataset created by Yann Lecun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges to train my own handwriting recognition model. The dataset contains 60,000 train and 10,000 test images, and was even able to recognize my handwriting (for the most part), which was quite the achievement!

### Melanoma Classification
Ì¥ç [melanoma-classification](https://github.com/alif-munim/r-tensorflow/blob/master/melanoma-classification/melanoma_classification.ipynb)

Recreating [alif-munim/deep-learning/tf-skin-cancer](https://github.com/alif-munim/deep-learning/blob/master/tf-skin-cancer/tf-skin-cancer.ipynb) using the same dataset from the ISIC (Internation Skin Imaging Collaboration) grand challenge archive, but this time using TensorFlow and Keras in R. Fewer images were also used due to R's memory constraints, which I have yet to work around in windows.
